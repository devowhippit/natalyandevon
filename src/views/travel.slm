    p There are regular Trailways buses to and from New York City ($60 each way), but we recommend renting a car or carpooling if you want to explore the area. If you can, we encourage you to take a long weekend to enjoy the spectacular hiking and charming local breweries and restaurants.

        p class='ta-left' Newark may be the best if you plan to drive directly to West Kill upon landing. La Guardia and John F. Kennedy have buses, trains, and cabs that can get you into the city if you plan to stay before heading up to West Kill. We recommend comparing all three for affordability.
